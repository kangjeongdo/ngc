                <p>When I was in elementary school, my grandfather, Theron C. Toole, pulled me aside 
                    at his house. He said he needed to talk to me about something important: our 
                    family history. He told me about my great-great-great grandfather, J.B. Stradford, 
                    and how he owned property, including a hotel, on Black Wall Street in Tulsa. I didn’t 
                    understand the significance of what he was saying then, but the words “Black Wall 
                    Street” stuck with me.</p>
                <p>Now I know more. May 31 marks the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
                    Massacre, when a white mob destroyed the thriving Black community of 
                    Greenwood, killing as many as 300 people. The attackers burned more than one 
                    thousand homes and numerous businesses—my ancestor J.B.’s properties among 
                    them and left nearly 10,000 people homeless, almost the entire Black population</p>
                <p>In addition to lives, Greenwood residents and their descendants, like me lost what 
                    would today total an estimated $610 million in accumulated wealth. We also lost a 
                    vibrant neighborhood created by successful Black business owners and 
                    entrepreneurs not even 50 years after the end of slavery. And at the heart of it was 
                    J.B, who did everything in his power to support and enhance the thriving 
                    community of Greenwood. </p>
                <p>Before the massacre, Greenwood, later remembered as Black Wall Street, bustled 
                    with 41 grocery stores, 30 restaurants, 11 boarding houses, nine billiard parlors, 
                    five hotels, and many other businesses, including laundry services, movie theatres, 
                    and a dance club. One of the most prominent was my great-great-great 
                    grandfather’s Stradford Hotel.</p>
                <p>“The most beautiful crystal chandeliers were hung in every banquet hall and lobby,” 
                    wrote J.B. in his unpublished memoir, which my cousin Nate Calloway shared with 
                    me recently. “The bright lights were flashing all over the place and the guest from 
                    afar and near were tripping the fantastic toe, enjoying the opening of the largest 
                    and finest hotel in the United States owned and operated and built by an African 
                    American.”</p>
                <p>J.B.’s memoir, which he wrote later in his life, recounts how he went from an 
                    impoverished childhood to a life of entrepreneurship and civic activism. His story 
                    starts in Versailles, Kentucky, where he was born on September 10, 1861. His 
                    father, Caesar, had been enslaved but worked hard to gain his freedom and to 
                    educate himself, even though it was at risk to his life.</p>
                <p>Caesar was taught to read by the abolitionist daughter of the family that enslaved 
                    him. “After each lesson,” wrote J.B. of his father, “he would put the book in the top 
                    of his hat," only taking it out when he could study unseen. “Early morning and 
                    evening were spent studying. This procedure continued long enough to enable him 
                    to read and write.”</p>
                <p>His father’s enslavement and educational process led J.B. to hold high educational 
                    standards for himself. He earned his undergraduate degree at Oberlin College in 
                    Ohio during a time when most universities did not admit Black students and then 
                    received his law degree from the Indianapolis College of Law, which was later 
                    absorbed by Indiana University.</p>
                <h4>COURTESY NATE CALLOWAY</h4>
                <p>He began his entrepreneurial journey at Oberlin, working at a barbershop 10 miles 
                    from the campus. “After the first month in Oberlin and liquidating my money, 
                    I rented two rooms, one for sleeping and the other for a barbershop,” he wrote. 
                    “Many of my classmates and citizens patronized me which enabled me to make my 
                    current expenses.”</p>
                <p>In Ohio he met Bertie Wiley, the woman he would marry. After graduation, the two 
                    returned to Kentucky, where J.B. worked as a school principal and owned a 
                    barbershop.</p>
                <p>In Kentucky, J.B. had an experience that shaped him for the rest of his life: He saw a 
                    man being lynched. A white woman had accused a Black man of rape but J.B. 
                    reported in his memoir that she was having an affair with the man and her husband 
                    caught them.</p>
                <p>When the man was taken out of the jail to be lynched, the rest of the Black 
                    community ran and hid but J.B. decided to stay and watch. He vividly describes the 
                    man’s death: His neck didn’t snap, and his tongue hung from his mouth “as large as a 
                    beeff [sic] tongue.” From that moment, J.B. determined to do all he could to stop 
                    lynchings.</p>
                <p>But he no longer felt safe in his home state. He and Bertie headed for Indiana with 
                    $15,000 in savings. He opened a bicycle store and another barbershop and earned 
                    his law degree in 1899. The couple then moved to Coffeyville, Kansas, where Bertie 
                    passed away.</p>
