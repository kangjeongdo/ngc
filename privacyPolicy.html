                    <li>
                        <p><strong>COMMUNICATE &colon;</strong> Once you have an idea of how your child uses the Internet and what is available to them, you can establish online guidelines and rules. Whether it’s setting guidelines about which sites to visit or what’s okay to do online, it is 
                            essential to clearly communicate the rules to your child.</p>
                        <p>Speak often to your child about potential risks and what to do in various situations. Encourage your child to ask questions about situations they run into. Being aware of the risks your child faces, and communicating frequently with your child about 
                            these risks, will help develop their judgment and responsibility about Internet usage.</p>

                        <p><strong>CYBER BULLIES &colon;</strong> Just as a child may encounter bullying or aggressive behavior from other students in school, they may be subject to bullying online. So-called “cyber bullies” may send harmful and cruel words or images through the Internet or an 
                            electronic device such as a cell phone, in order to harass, embarrass, humiliate, and threaten their target. Other forms of bullying include password hacking, identity theft and blackmail. Many kids may be equally likely to become bullies or victims. While 
                            some are anonymous, cyber bullies are often kids who are known by a child from their school, camp, community group, or neighborhood.</p>
                        <p>It is important to talk openly with children about how to handle cyber bullying issues. If your child encounters a form of cyber bullying, remember that bullies thrive on the reactions of their targets. Children should avoid escalating the situation by 
                            refraining from responding to the bully. Parents should contact your local authorities if the problem persists. Be sure to save all messages, including dates and time.</p>

                        <p><strong>RESOURCES &colon;</strong> Children as young as two are interacting with the Internet from their parents’ laps. As they get older, however, they may begin to venture online by themselves, with as much support and guidance as you can provide. It is up to parents to 
                            decide which controls to put in place and when to ease up as children grow and mature in their decision-making.</p>
