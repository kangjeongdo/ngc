                <p>One autumn morning near the village of Radavc in the Rugova Valley of Kosovo, I 
                    took a walking path from my hotel along the White Drin River, a brisk and chilly 
                    habitat for trout that flows from the Rusolia peak of the Accursed Mountains nearly 
                    a hundred miles southward into Albania.</p>
                <p>The river’s waterfall, Kosovo’s largest, is a wondrous spectacle of episodic cascades. 
                    Eventually, I continued along the trail for another half-mile, past the season’s final 
                    white blooming vestiges of edelweiss, until I arrived at the gated entrance of a cave.</p>
                <p>A young woman in her twenties sat in a nearby booth. Her name was Melisa Bojku, 
                    and after accepting two Euros, she handed me a hard hat, walked with her keychain 
                    to the gate and together we squeezed our way through the cave’s narrow mouth. It 
                    was cold and humid inside. A few bats flew above our heads. A musty but not 
                    overpowering scent of guano hung in the air. The cave’s floor was slick but not 
                    difficult to navigate, and its brawny limestone corridors were discreetly illuminated 
                    with green, yellow, and red lights. It was at the same time austere and baroque, like 
                    entering a magnificent cathedral of a primordial deity.</p>
                <p>Bojku said that the hydrologically chiseled cave was at least two million years old 
                    and that the damp stalagmite knobs beside our feet were mere babies, probably 
                    about 500 years of age, compared to the glistening stalactites overhead. She 
                    pointed out the red iron oxide streaks describing the ancient collision between 
                    limestone and volcanic rock. Descending steadily, we eventually could see the dark 
                    contour of a subterranean canal. Further beneath us, there dwelled a large if 
                    invisible population of crickets that subsisted on insects from the bat guano.</p>
                <h4>Stalactites in Marble Cave, Gadime</h4>
                <p>We couldn’t visit an additional room, Bojku apologized, because it contained 
                    Neolithic human remains from six thousand years ago that were now being 
                    examined by archaeologists. A bullet from World War I had also been found there, 
                    as well as a man’s pipe from that era. There may also be evidence of World War II 
                    soldiers there, according to stories locals had told her. Who knows what else might 
                    turn up during the digging?</p>
                <p>There may be a thousand bats in the cave, representing eight different species. “
                    During the day, they’re chilling out,” Bojku said. With a shy smile, she added, “I like 
                    to come in here after I get off work, around four or five in the afternoon, just to 
                    stand and listen to them flying around and going crazy. My friends think I’m a little 
                    bit strange.”</p>
                <h4>Cave nerds</h4>
                <p>The Sleeping Beauty Cave, as the ancient Radavc geological phenomenon is now 
                    known, was first discovered in 1968 by Serbian archaeologists. But it would not 
                    appear on any Kosovo map, much less be a touristic destination that attracts up to 
                    23,000 adult visitors a year, were it not for the efforts of Fatos Katallozi, the 
                    57 year old outdoorsman who took a perfectly normal schoolgirl in Bojku and 
                    trained her to become a cave nerd.</p>
                <p>Katalozzi is almost singlehandedly responsible for establishing Kosovo as a major 
                    cave-exploration site in Europe. His story is very much in keeping with that of other 
                    Kosovars who have shown remarkable determination in rebuilding their war-torn 
                    country over the past two decades.</p>
                <p>Though the renowned caves of the world include a few made entirely of ice (such as 
                    the giant Eisriesenwelt in Werfen, Austria), and others of volcanic lava (like the 
                    Cueva de los Verdes in the Canary Islands), the vast majority of them are produced 
                    from porous limestone.</p>
                <p>The Balkans region, with 70 percent of its earth composed of limestone, is therefore 
                    over-abundant with caves. The most famous of these is also Europe’s largest: the 
                    15-mile-long Postojna cave in Slovenia, which was discovered 200 years ago and 
                    has attracted a staggering 38 million visitors during that time. Romania’s caves 
                    include some that are deeper than Postojna, while a great deal of recent exploration 
                    has been devoted to the caves in Albania and Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>Though Kosovo is barely the size of Connecticut, it is a nature lover’s small paradise 
                    of muscular mountains and glittering waterways. The world has been slow to take 
                    note of this. So, frankly, has Kosovo’s government. As the newest country in the 
                    Balkans, not to mention the poorest and one that has yet to receive official 
                    recognition by its neighbor Serbia, war-scarred Kosovo has not had an easy time 
                    selling itself as a vacation spot. The country lacks a Ministry of Tourism. It has only 
                    two national parks that are almost completely unstaffed. Kosovo’s underdeveloped 
                    tourist industry has therefore relied heavily on the initiative of local protagonists 
                    like Katallozi.</p>
                <p>I met Katallozi at his business, Outdoor Kosovo, which is situated in the ancient 
                    gold and silver trading city of Peja. The city was mostly razed by Serbian troops 
                    during the war in 1999 and has subsequently been rebuilt. The exterior of Katallozi’s 
                    office still bears scorch marks from the war.</p>
                <p>Lanky and with hawkish facial features, Katallozi led me to his jeep, which was 
                    loaded down with spelunking gear. We drove northwest, out of the city traffic and 
                    another 20 minutes into the Rugova Valley, plunging into a forested range that was 
                    electric with autumn foliage and waterfalls seeping out of seemingly every 
                    mountain façade.</p>
