                    they’re also up against a unique stigma: the Napoleon complex.</p>
                <p>Named for the tyrannical and aggressive dictator with ambitions far larger than his 
                    physical frame, pop psychologists began using this term in the early 20th century to 
                    describe short men with domineering personalities. Here’s how the so-called 
                    “Napoleon complex” came to be and why historians still disagree about whether its 
                    namesake Napoleon Bonaparte was really all that short.</p>
                <h4>Who was Napoleon?</h4>
                <p>Napoleon Bonaparte first gained fame when he helped France wrest an unlikely 
                    victory against the Austrians in Italy in 1796 earning him the nickname the “Little 
                    Corporal.” His military prowess led to even more victories, all characterized by 
                    daring, even foolhardy, strategies. Hailed as a national hero, he seized political 
                    power over France in a 1799 coup. As emperor, he attempted to expand France’s 
                    reach across the world.</p>
                <p>Napoleon had charisma and huge ambitions. But throughout his life and career, 
                    Napoleon was ridiculed for his short stature. His own soldiers gave him several pet 
                    names, most of which started with “le petit” (“the little”), and he was consistently 
                    portrayed by his critics as a tiny, pugnacious man who attempted to make up for his 
                    height by intimidating and dominating those around him.</p>
                <p>The most enduring parodies were created by James Gillray, a British caricaturist 
                    who helped birth the modern political cartoon. Gillray never saw Napoleon in 
                    person. But he mocked the military leader as a childlike man intent on turning the 
                    world into his plaything, calling him “little Boney” and showing him as a toddler 
                    like figure in too-large clothing. In one memorable 1803 cartoon, for example, 
                    British king George III literally holds the French leader in his palm, looking at him 
                    through a spyglass.</p>
                <p>It would take a disastrous Russian campaign, a coalition among his European rivals, 
                    and the growing discontentment of the French people to bring Napoleon down. He 
                    was deposed in 1814 and spent nine months in exile on the Italian island of Elba 
                    then briefly returned to mount a last stand at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The 
                    battle was a disaster, and Napoleon was forced back into exile until his death in 
                    1821.</p>
                <h4>But how short was Napoleon really?</h4>
                <p>Just how short was Napoleon? Historians disagree on the answer. During his life, 
                    Napoleon was described as both slight and impressive, short and average.</p>
                <p>Part of the ongoing confusion seems to stem from the difference in the French and 
                    English measuring systems. More than one Napoleon observer said he was about 
                    five foot six inches tall, and this was confirmed at his autopsy. But that was often 
                    expressed in France’s pre-Revolutionary measurement system. The French “pouce,” 
                    or “inch,” equaled 1.06 English inches, which meant that in France at the time, 
                    Napoleon was said to be five feet two inches tall.</p>
                <p>Historians also point out that Napoleon was often seen in public in the presence of 
                    Old Guard grenadiers, who were required to be physically large and who wore 
                    uniforms that may have made the emperor look slight in comparison.</p>
                <p>Then there’s the deception of appearances. One contemporary, nobleman and 
                    ambassador Hyde de Neuville, recalled thinking the man was short. But after 
                    Napoleon looked him in the eye during a 1799 meeting, he wrote in his memoirs, 
                    “I lost all my assurance under the fire of that questioning eye. To me he had 
                    suddenly grown taller by a hundred cubits.”</p>
                <p>So why was Napoleon so relentlessly mocked? That might have come down to 
                    anxieties about his outsized ambitions, which prompted his enemies to try to cut 
                    him down to size. As art historian Constance McPhee writes, British cartoonists 
                    like Gillray “manipulated size and dress to symbolically deflate a threatening 
                    military opponent, and produced an image that communicates so effortlessly, we 
                    often forget it was invented.”</p>
