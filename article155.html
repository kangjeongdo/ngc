                <p>When Glo Lindenmuth was sick with COVID-19 in December 2021, she was 
                    congested and exhausted for about a week; her sense of smell and taste were gone 
                    for two weeks. She knew about these symptoms before she caught the virus and 
                    wasn’t surprised by them. But the sadness and trouble sleeping that kicked in 
                    weeks after she recovered from COVID caught her off-guard.</p>
                <p>“I had depression as a teenager, but this was much worse,” says Lindenmuth, 30, 
                    who works in corporate communications in New York City. In addition to suddenly 
                    feeling down, she had trouble sleeping and bad dreams. When she was awake, her 
                    brain was foggy and bleak thoughts often about doing something harmful to 
                    herself intruded. And though she was typically bubbly and extroverted, she was 
                    overwhelmed with social anxiety. “I’d cancel plans with friends, sleep all day on the 
                     weekends, and avoid the majority of calls and texts,” she says.</p>
                <p>Her symptoms lasted for more than two months.</p>
                <p>In the spring, Lindenmuth began feeling a bit better but then another intense wave 
                    of depression enveloped her from mid-June to mid-August. That’s when she went 
                    to see a behavioral psychiatrist who diagnosed her with depression.</p>
                <p>It’s estimated that millions of people are discovering that even after they think 
                    they have bounced back from their COVID-19 illness, they continue to feel down, 
                    fatigued, apathetic, anxious, or otherwise emotionally out of sorts.</p>
                <p>In a study based on millions of people who used the U.S. Department of Veterans 
                    Affairs health system, “we noticed that we had a nation in distress, due to the 
                    mayhem of the pandemic and lockdown,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the clinical 
                    epidemiology center at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and a 
                    coauthor of the report. Al-Aly and his colleagues wanted to know whether people 
                    who got COVID-19 had a higher risk of mental health problems after symptoms of 
                    the illness subsided. “The answer was absolutely yes. People with COVID had it 
                    much, much worse.” </p>
                <p>According to research in the June 2022 issue of the journal CNS Drugs, 35 percent 
                    of people reported depressive symptoms after recovering from COVID. And it may 
                    not be simply because they lost days or weeks of their regularly scheduled lives to 
                    COVID. It may be because they have a little-known phenomenon called post-viral 
                    depression, which is likely triggered by inflammatory changes, psychological stress, 
                    and other factors.</p>
                <p>These symptoms typically “kick in two to three months after the onset of 
                    COVID-19 and seem to last several months,” says Madhukar Trivedi, a psychiatrist 
                    and founding director of the Center for Depression Research and Clinical Care at 
                    the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “There’s no way to predict who will 
                    have transient effects or who will have persistent ones.”</p>
                <h4>The scope of the phenomenon</h4>
                <p>The link between viral illnesses and depression isn’t new but has become more 
                    widely recognized and understood in recent decades. A study in a 2016 issue of the 
                    journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, for example, found that people who were 
                    sick with the flu in the previous 30 to 180 days had a 57 percent higher risk of new 
                    onset depression, compared to those who dodged the virus. Post-viral depression 
                    also can happen with the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, and 
                    other non-specific viruses, experts say.</p>
                <p>Al-Aly’s study, published in February 2022 in BMJ, found that people who’d been 
                    sick with COVID had a 35 percent higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder and 
                    a 39 percent higher risk of experiencing a bout of depression a month after their 
                    illness; these surges were accompanied by increased use of antidepressants and 
                    benzodiazepines.</p>
                <p>This is far from an isolated finding. A study in the April 2022 issue of the Journal of 
                    Neurology  found that elevated levels of apathy and anxiety were common among 
                    COVID survivors who had fatigue eight months after their illness. And in a study in 
                    the May 2022 issue of The Lancet, researchers followed the mental-health 
                    trajectory of people in six countries in Europe who had been sick with COVID but 
                    weren’t hospitalized for it and found that these individuals had a higher prevalence 
                    of depression in the subsequent months, especially if they had been bedridden with 
                    the illness.</p>
                <h4>Mechanisms behind the misery</h4>
                <p>Exactly how COVID-19 triggers depression isn’t fully understood but there are 
                    several hypotheses. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause more inflammation in the 
                    brain and activate microglial cells, immune cells in the central nervous system that 
                    produce inflammatory molecules, Al-Aly explains. “Inflammation can affect brain 
                    regions that regulate affect and emotions it can turn them up or turn them down.”</p>
                <p>Another theory is that the virus can attack the lining of blood vessels, which can 
                    compromise the blood and oxygen supply to the brain and disrupt areas that 
                    regulate emotion, Al-Aly adds. </p>
                <p>A third hypothesis suggests that the virus can disrupt the diversity and equilibrium 
                    of the bacteria in the gut the gut microbiome which could in turn alter the levels of 
                    certain neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that transmit nerve signals 
                    throughout the body and brain and are involved in mood regulation, he says. 
                    “What’s really clear is that the virus’s effect on mental health is a biological 
                    phenomenon it’s not imagined,” Al-Aly says. </p>
                <p>That’s not to say there aren’t psychological elements at play. Prolonged isolation 
                    and feelings of loneliness during the illness may contribute to post-COVID 
                    depression, says Pravesh Sharma, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic College of 
                    Medicine and Sciences in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. When it comes to post-COVID 
                    depression, “sometimes people think why me?” Sharma says. “That creates a lot of 
                    negative thought and affects how people function in everyday life.” These factors 
                    can trigger a vicious cycle that traps people in a depressive state.</p>
