                <p>Mehnaz Qureshi has caught COVID-19 seven times, despite being fully vaccinated 
                    and boosted. A veterinarian and a virologist at The Pirbright Institute in England, 
                    she first caught the disease in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was just 
                    beginning; then everyone in her family got sick.</p>
                <p>While Qureshi's own symptoms were mild, her family members fared worse some 
                    requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen to breathe. As the mother of 
                    two children and the family’s primary care giver she didn't have much time to think, 
                    or treat, her own symptoms. "I almost forgot about myself," says Qureshi. But 
                    COVID-19 hadn't forgotten her.</p>
                <p>"For me, it has been just four to six months of window between each reinfection," 
                    says Qureshi. Aside from disrupting her life seven times, her symptoms during 
                    subsequent reinfections have been more severe.</p>
                <p>While a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection can protect against a reinfection for an 
                    average of seven months, the immunity wanes afterwards. Repeated bouts of 
                    COVID-19 are harmful even if the episodes are mild because the long-term 
                    consequences add up for each additional infection, as demonstrated in a study of 
                    U.S. veterans. While veterans don't necessarily reflect the broader public because 
                    they tend to be older, white, and male the research shows that patients who were 
                    reinfected with any SARS-CoV-2 variant are much more likely to develop chronic 
                    health issues like diabetes, kidney disease, organ failure, and even mental health 
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Qureshi’s first infection was mild, with a fever that lasted a couple of days, aches, 
                    and cold symptoms, she recalls. "My major symptom was that I lost smell and taste.
                    " But the most recent infection was disabling. She was bedridden for a week, could 
                    barely stand, and had severe cognitive impairment. "I couldn't think straight," says 
                    Qureshi. "The most recent one was really bad."</p>
                <p>With reinfections rising it is good news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
                    approved Pfizer’s and Moderna’s new COVID-19 boosters on September 11. The 
                    preliminary data from Moderna, which has not yet been peer reviewed and 
                    published, shows that the XBB.1.5 based booster, which could be available to the
                     public as soon as this week generates ample levels of antibodies not only against 
                    the latest highly mutated Omicron BA.2.86 variant, but also against other 
                    currently circulating strains, EG.5.1 and FL.1.5.1.</p>
                <p>After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on 
                    Immunization Practices met yesterday and voted in favor of the new shots, CDC 
                    director Mandy Cohen signed off on the panel's recommendations. "CDC is now 
                    recommending updated COVID-19 vaccination for everyone six months and older 
                    to better protect you and your loved ones."</p>
                <p>“I certainly recommend at all of my preventative visits that patients complete their 
                    primary COVID series and stay up to date on the boosters,” says Natalie Paul, a 
                    family nurse practitioner at Lavender Spectrum Health in Longview, Washington. 
                    While vaccines and boosters may not block new or reinfections, they provide a 
                    strong protection against serious complications or hospitalization. “I personally 
                    would get it myself.”</p>
                <h4>Soaring reinfection rates</h4>
                <p>The CDC defines a reinfection as when someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 the 
                    virus that causes COVID-19 on a PCR test 45 days after recovering from a previous 
                    confirmed infection. In the United States, about 2.7 percent of all reported COVID 
                    cases during the Delta variant surge in late 2021 were reinfections. But the 
                    problem became significantly worse when Omicron emerged, and its more 
                    infectious subvariants became dominant.</p>
                <p>A CDC analysis of lab-confirmed, adult COVID cases between September 2021 and 
                    December 2022, found that reinfection rates jumped to 10.3 percent during the 
                    Omicron BA.1 wave; 12.5 percent when BA.2 was dominant; 20.6 percent during 
                    BA.4/BA.5; and 28.8 percent during the BQ.1/BQ.1.1. The good news is that a meta 
                    analysis of 91 published studies showed that vaccination lowered the risk of 
                    getting reinfected, although vaccines became less efficient in preventing 
                    reinfections against Omicron variants.</p>
                <p>But the numbers of reinfections are likely to be underestimated because not 
                    everyone who gets infected with SARS-CoV-2 gets sick enough to get tested. Since 
                    reinfection often generates somewhat milder symptoms, it is even more difficult to 
                    fully assess the true tally. Being a virologist, Qureshi frequently takes COVID tests 
                    when she suspects something is off, and that's why she knows she has had frequent 
                    re-infections.</p>
                <p>A Canadian study estimated that 40 percent of people who had antibodies in their 
                    blood proof that they had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 had not experienced any 
                    symptoms in the previous six months and were unaware they had gotten the 
                    disease.</p>
                <p>Studies from various other countries also suggest that reinfection rates can range 
                    from 5 percent to 15 percent. An analysis of COVID-19 cases in Serbia, for example, 
                    found that risk of getting reinfected has steadily increased during the pandemic, 
                    but it spiked after the arrival of Omicron variants in December 2022.</p>
