                <p>A few days after Michele Hart tested negative following a COVID infection in June 
                    2022, she started participating in virtual meetings for her job. But after each call, 
                    she crawled back into bed to rest. When she returned home from a three-day work 
                    trip, more than a week after her negative test, she spent the entire weekend in bed 
                    recovering. An avid runner and hiker, she had stopped doing both because she was 
                    tired and, she thought, possibly depressed. She wondered if she would ever feel 
                    well again.</p>
                <p>“One of the things I found myself doing after that initial 10 days was, at least once a 
                    day, Googling something like, ‘When will I be better?’” says Hart, 45, a product 
                    specialist for a school curriculum company. The answers were frustrating: “Hang in 
                    there. Some people have it like this. Some people have it like that.”</p>
                <p>COVID symptoms often don’t end when people test negative, which usually 
                    happens after about 10 days. Symptoms can last for weeks, months, or more. In one 
                    of the latest studies on lingering symptoms, researchers in Scotland surveyed more 
                    than 31,000 people who’d had symptomatic infections and found that 42 percent 
                    reported they had not fully recovered between six and 18 months after their 
                    infection began.</p>
                <p>But when do ongoing COVID symptoms officially become long COVID, and how 
                    can someone know if they have a chronic condition or symptoms that will go away 
                    eventually?</p>
                <p>Those are tricky questions without satisfying answers, says Michael VanElzakker, a 
                    neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
                    Long COVID, while an active area of research, is not a clearly defined condition with 
                    specific medical criteria. There is no single diagnostic test to confirm it and no easy 
                    way to explain what is causing symptoms. Many studies are ongoing, but answers 
                    are still a work in progress.</p>
                <p>“A core question still remains,” VanElzakker says. “Why do some people seem to 
                    fully recover, and some don’t?”</p>
                <h4>What is long COVID?</h4>
                <p>There is still no medical consensus about what the condition should be called, 
                    which symptoms it encompasses, how long a person must be sick before being 
                    diagnosed with it, or exactly how many people experience it.</p>
                <p>Symptoms need to persist for at least three months after a probable or confirmed 
                    COVID infection to meet the World Health Organization’s definition of a post 
                    COVID condition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers 
                    four weeks long enough to suspect long COVID, which is also called post-acute 
                    sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), long-haul COVID, chronic COVID, and 
                    other names.</p>
                <p>After multiple large studies it still isn’t clear how many people are suffering from 
                    long-term symptoms, which are wide ranging. A study conducted in Germany 
                    identified 96 potential symptoms and found many of them in people who’d had 
                    prior infections. For young people, the most common symptoms included fatigue, 
                    cough, throat and chest pain, headache, fever, abdominal pain, anxiety, and 
                    depression. For adults, frequent ongoing symptoms included changes to smell and 
                    taste, fever, trouble breathing, coughing, throat and chest pain, hair loss, fatigue, 
                    exhaustion, and headache.</p>
                <p>The Scottish study considered 26 persistent symptoms, including headaches, loss 
                    of taste and smell, tiredness, heart palpitations, constipation, breathlessness, joint 
                    pain, dizziness, and depression. But complicating the issue of diagnosis was that 
                    people who hadn’t tested positive for COVID also experienced many of those same 
                    symptoms.</p>
                <p>While 42 percent of people in the Scottish study had some lingering symptoms, an 
                    additional 6 percent said they hadn’t recovered at all. German researchers found 
                    that adults, kids, and adolescents with a prior COVID infection were about 30 
                    percent more likely than people without a positive COVID test to report a new 
                    condition more than three months after their infection. About 14 percent of more 
                    than 41,000 of people who responded to a CDC survey in October reported having 
                    persistent symptoms at least three months after a COVID infection.</p>
                <p>Across studies, it looks like somewhere between one in five and one in 20 people 
                    end up with long COVID symptoms, says David Putrino, a neuroscientist at Mount 
                    Sinai Health System in New York. To him, the exact number is less important than 
                    the reality of the implications. “If any of those are true, it's an enormous number,” 
                    he says. “My clinic already has a six-month waitlist crammed out the door. None of 
                    us are sleeping. We’re all just treating 24/7.”</p>
                <h4>Will I get better?</h4>
                <p>Some might ultimately meet the criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic 
                    fatigue syndrome, known shorthand as ME/CFS, a chronic condition that can be 
                    caused by viral infections. About 10 percent of people with severe cases of Epstein 
                    Barr go on to develop ME/CFS, VanElzakker says. He suspects this will happen to a 
                    subset of long COVID patients.</p>
                <p>On the flip side are people with lingering issues that ultimately go away, says 
                    VanElzakker, who lost patches of hair from his beard for several months after his 
                    own bouts with the virus. “Simply because someone doesn't feel better after three 
                    weeks,” he says, “doesn't mean they're never going to get better.”</p>
