                <p>Terry G. Collins is no stranger to peaceful protest.  The Birmingham, Alabama 
                    native visited churches with his parents as a child where civil rights leaders talked 
                    about challenging injustices. In 1963, at 15 years old, he was subject to attacks by 
                    police dogs and was sprayed by fire hoses while participating in civil rights marches.  
                    Some of his friends were arrested.</p>
                <p>Now 73, Collins traveled to Washington D.C. on the 58th anniversary of Martin 
                    Luther King, Jr.’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, to advocate for 
                    voting rights. Saturday’s March On for Voting Rights included demonstrations from 
                    Atlanta, Georgia to Salt Lake City, Utah to draw attention to recent voting 
                    legislation that many Americans believe suppresses voting, particularly for non 
                    white and young American voters. </p>
                <p>Collins believes that peaceful protest is the way to drive change, and if he and 
                    others had not protested in 1963 the laws enacted following those events wouldn’t 
                    have passed.</p>
                <p>“If it had not been for the marches in Birmingham in 1963, the Civil Rights Act 
                    never would have been an act,” Collins says.  “The 1964 and 65 civil rights and 
                    voting rights acts would never have been had it not been for the marches that 
                    occurred in Birmingham and in Selma and places like that, that demonstrated 
                    against the injustices that were ongoing as a part of the times and are still prevalent 
                    in our country.”</p>
                <p>In 2021, 18 states have enacted 30 new laws that restrict voter access. The laws 
                    establish harsher voter ID requirements and make mail-in voting and early voting 
                    more challenging, among other restrictions.</p>
                <p>Voting rights advocates expressed support for the John R. Lewis Voting Rights 
                    Advancement Act, named for the congressman and civil rights leader who died last 
                    year, which was passed by the U. S. House of Representatives on August 24th.  The 
                    bill would restore the full protections of the original, bipartisan Voting Rights Act 
                    of 1965, which was last reauthorized by Congress in 2006, but reconstructed by the 
                    U. S. Supreme Court in 2013. Those protesting say the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling 
                    has contributed to voter restrictions.</p>
                <p>Participants included family members of both King and Lewis, the youngest 
                    organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, and the brothers of George Floyd 
                    whose murder by Minneapolis police in 2020 sparked global protests.  Natacha 
                    Chavez, the granddaughter-in-law of civil rights activist Cesar Chavez attended the 
                    Phoenix march with her husband Alejandro, and their two children Amelia, and 
                    Alejandro.</p>
                <p>“We want to carry on that legacy, and we see that Cesar’s fight and Martin Luther 
                    King’s fight aren't over,” Chavez said.  “And not just those two, there's plenty of 
                    others during that time period who were working together with them like John 
                    Lewis. We need to finish their work.”</p>
                <p>From Phoenix to Miami, Saturday’s peaceful protests united people from different 
                    backgrounds for a common cause.</p>
                <p>Matthew Yatsayte, 25, a Navajo and Zuni voting activist who participated in the 
                    Phoenix event, said he was inspired by the range of voices represented. </p>
                <h4>History of voting rights efforts</h4>
                <p>The battle for voting rights has been an ongoing part of American history. 
                    Following the Declaration of Independence in 1776, white male property owners 
                    over the age of 21 were the only eligible voters. By 1787, the U.S. Constitution gave 
                    states the power to set voting mandates, which excluded women, African 
                    Americans, and Native Americans. Some white men also were excluded from voting 
                    based on property ownership requirements.</p>
                <p>More than a century later, the 15th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 
                    and ratified in 1870, prohibiting the federal government or states from denying 
                    American citizens the right to vote based on "race, color, or previous condition of 
                    servitude." Nevertheless, many forms of voter suppression would continue 
                    including poll taxes, literacy tests, fraud, and intimidation. Native Americans were 
                    still denied the right to vote.</p>
                <p>Though Black men had the right to vote despite the challenges that came with it, 
                    women, including white women, weren’t allowed to vote until the passage of the 
                    19th Amendment in 1920 , which stated, “The right of citizens of the United States 
                    to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on 
                    account of sex.” Despite the 19th Amendment, many non-white women faced voter 
                    discrimination when going to the polls.</p>
                <p>In 1924, Congress enacted the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted citizenship to 
                    all Native Americans born in the U.S. The right to vote, however, would be granted 
                    by states and many Native Americans in some states would not be allowed the 
                    right to vote until the late 1950s.</p>
