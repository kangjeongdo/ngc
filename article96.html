                <p>When journalist Dorothy Tucker first learned about the 10 Million Names 
                    genealogical project, it helped amplify memories of long car journeys from Chicago 
                    to “Down South” in the 1960’s, where her mother’s family owned land.</p>
                <p>The Mississippi property purchased by her great-grandfather George Trice in 1881 
                    was special for several reasons. First, nobody’s really sure how a formerly enslaved 
                    man was able to purchase 160 acres, but Trice came up with the $800. And every 
                    time Tucker and her family drove down to Shannon, Mississippi each summer to 
                    visit relatives, it was more than just a vacation.</p>

                    down the road and have lunch at my great-aunt's house. And then I'd play outside at 
                    my cousin's house,” says Tucker, an award-winning investigative journalist with 
                    CBS2 WBBM-TV in Chicago. “It was that way all day long. Every house was owned 
                    by a relative. I thought everybody lived like this. I thought everybody had land and 
                    stuff that was theirs.”</p>
                <p>Tucker finally got specific details about how and why that land was purchased 
                    during the final months of her term as president of the National Association of 
                    Black Journalists. In early 2023, NABJ Board Member Paula Madison, a retired 
                    NBC Universal executive, informed the group about an offshoot of the Georgetown 
                    Memory Project, the initiative that unearthed information about the 1838 sale of 
                    enslaved Africans to fund Georgetown University. The 10 Million Names Project 
                    was created to recover the names of an estimated 10 million men, women and 
                    children of African descent who were enslaved in pre- and post-colonial America 
                    between the 1500’s and 1865. By engaging with expert genealogists, cultural 
                    organizations, and family historians both Black and white, the initiative hopes to 
                    provide more African Americans with information that only formally began to be 
                    captured for their ancestors in the 1870 United States Census.</p>
                <p>Up until that year, enslaved Africans and their descendants were only 
                    acknowledged as the property of their owners. If their existence was noted, it was 
                    in the form of sales documents or as catalogued property in civil records. Also, the 
                    relatives of enslavers often maintain troves of information about those purchased 
                    and sold off that would otherwise be completely lost.</p>
                <p>Much of the work will be dependent on oral histories passed down thru generations 
                    of families, and researchers of the 10 Million Names Project also hope that more 
                    white families will aid in the search by making familial records, like letters and 
                    pages from family bibles, available to them.</p>
                <p>Tucker, who ended her term as NABJ president during that organization’s annual 
                    conference in August, revealed at the awards banquet in Birmingham, Alabama 
                    that she’d been able to learn more about her great grandfather’s real-estate 
                    ventures, through a collaboration between NABJ and the New England Historical 
                    Genealogical Society’s American Ancestors initiative.</p>
                <p>The 10 Million Names Project was formally launched at the convention. Tucker 
                    considers it an especially timely parting gift to her journalistic colleagues. As 
                    societal divisions along racial lines widen, hate crimes continue, and attempts to 
                    ban books and curtail African American studies programs in schools and 
                    universities increase, strengthening historical knowledge is urgently important for 
                    Black Americans, Tucker says.</p>
                <p>“I think that the ability to tell these stories and to know them is so critically 
                    important,” she says. “When you know your personal story, then as a journalist, it 
                    gives you the perspective to dig deeper when you're doing the next story, whether 
                    it’s about the school board or about Ukraine or the next elections. You know, these 
                    stories are all tools that are really good for all of us.”</p>
                <h4>How the initiative evolved</h4>
                <p>The man who is the catalyst for the Georgetown Memory Project and 10 Million 
                    Names says he’s never really been interested in investigating his own family tree.</p>
                <p>“To me, genealogy was sort of like butterfly collecting,” says Richard Cellini, a 
                    faculty fellow at Harvard University and founding director of the Harvard Legacy of 
                    Slavery Remembrance Program. “It’s impressive because of the amount of effort 
                    invested into it. But I never quite understood the point.”</p>
                <p>Cellini was born in 1963 in Central Pennsylvania to a Penn State University 
                    professor and homemaker mother. His Catholic upbringing steered him to Georget
                    own University and an eventual decade-long law career before pivoting toward the 
                    software and technology realm. In 2015, Cellini learned that his alma mater had 
                    formed a working group to explore the sale of 272 men, woman, and children in 
                    1838 to rescue the university from bankruptcy. As a white American of European 
                    descent, he says he did not live with or know many Black people growing up, going 
                    to school or during his legal and technology careers, so the initiative opened a 
                    window in his mind.</p>

                                zoologist at Sweden’s Linkoping University. “They’re definitely better at
