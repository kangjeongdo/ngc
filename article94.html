                <p>Tents and animals. Horses and swords. The early days of the Mongol Empire were 
                    characterized by battle, conquest, and quick expansion, leading the people ruled by 
                    Genghis Khan to domination of the world’s largest contiguous empire.</p>
                <p>But the great khan didn’t rule alone: His principal wife, Börte, was a critical player 
                    in the establishment of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Here’s how the first 
                    Mongol empress exerted her influence and why she and other women are among 
                    the empire’s unsung heroes.</p>
                <h4>Who was Börte? </h4>
                <p>Born around 1161 to the Olkhonoud tribe of what is now inner Mongolia, Börte 
                    was betrothed to the future emperor known as Temüjin in his early years as a child. 
                    Though details about her life are scant, historians know that she married Temüjin, 
                    who came from the Borjigin tribe, as a teenager. But their newlywed bliss was 
                    shortlived: soon after the marriage, Börte was abducted by a member of the 
                    Merkit tribe.</p>
                <p>Bride kidnapping was common at the time, and rival tribes did so both to disrupt 
                    the lives of their enemies and to settle scores. By kidnapping Temüjin’s new wife, 
                    the Merkits were attempting to avenge a longstanding grievance: Temüjin’s 
                    mother, Hö’elün, had originally been married to a Merkit before she was abducted 
                    by Yesügei, Temüjin’s father.</p>
                <p>Although such kidnappings usually resulted in the woman being forced to stay with 
                    her captor, Temüjin decided to pursue an unexpected course: Along with his close 
                    friend Jamukha, he managed a daring rescue of his new wife. This kicked off outright 
                    war between the Borjigins and the Merkits. The Borjigins eventually won, 
                    enslaving Merkits women and overtaking their territory, in 1200.</p>
                <p>Just a few years later, Temüjin formally adopted the name Genghis (also spelled 
                    Chinggis) Khan and became the emperor of a newly united group of tribes that 
                    would become known as the Mongols.</p>
                <h4>Women of influence </h4>
                <p>Temüjin continued to conquer other tribes for decades, building the Mongols into a 
                    feared force that united warring tribes and overtook more and more territory. 
                    Meanwhile, Börte became his principal wife.</p>
                <p>Over the years, the emperor would marry at least six women, amass hundreds of 
                    concubines, and have at least 13 children. But as his first and most favored wife, 
                    Börte was the most influential of them all, and her role as principal wife also 
                    entailed caring for her husband’s expanding empire.</p>
                <p>Her importance would have been visible to all, says Anne Broadbridge, a professor 
                    of history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the author of Women 
                    and the Making of the Mongol Empire. Principal wives managed their own ordo, or 
                    household, and were waited on by massive staffs. From concubines and lesser 
                    wives to herds of animals, shepherds, servants, and security guards, women’s 
                    households could number in the hundreds.</p>
                <p>Their households may have been mobile as the nomadic group moved from 
                    destination to destination, but they were anything but compact. Instead, these 
                    households reached a dizzying scale that attracted the attention of chroniclers and 
                    the conquered, who left behind historical records of the women’s wealth. During 
                    the rule of Genghis Khan’s grandson, Kublai, for example, the households of the 
                    emperor’s four wives may have each included up to 10,000 people, including 
                    servants and staff. Wives also traveled with thousands of animals and hundreds of 
                    wagons.</p>
                <h4>A shrewd strategist</h4>
                <p>But Börte’s influence extended far beyond her children and her yurt. Her place in 
                    the Mongol hierarchy offered her coveted access to her husband, who sought out 
                    her advice on everything from politics to military strategy.</p>
                <p>She put that trust to good use, even when it came to the emperor’s closest friends. 
                    One of them was Jamukha, her husband’s closest friend who had helped him save 
                    her after she was kidnapped and who eventually became khan of the Jadaran. 
                    When Börte saw signs that the friends’ alliance was crumbling, she advised her 
                    husband to break off the friendship, and in 1204 Temüjin defeated Jamukha in 
                    battle and had him executed.</p>
                <p>Another political intervention had to do with Teb Tenggeri, a shaman who was one 
                    of the khan’s close companions. Teb had predicted Temüjin’s rise to power, and thus 
                    seemed entitled to a role in the khan’s court. When he publicly insulted Temüjin’s 
                    brother, though, Börte drew the line and insisted that her husband severely punish 
                    the shaman.</p>
